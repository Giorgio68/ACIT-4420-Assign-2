# ACIT4420 Assignment 2

## Installation

Installation is relatively straight-forward: simply run
```pip install .```
to install the package.

## Importing contacts

Contacts can be given in different formats, such as a python list, stored in a CSV, JSON or text file. The file names can be provided as both a single file or a list of files, and as either a string or `pathlib.Path` object.
A separator can also be specified for CSV and text files if so desired.
